# Minecraft 1.21.4 client for Hypixel Skyblock

This is a simple client that I'm currently developing, as of October 2025.

Currently it has simple farming macro functionality, planning to expand it in the future.

## How to use

Press J to open the user interface.

Click on "New scene" to create your first node scene, which serves as a container for the macro's nodes.

A node is comprised of a world position and a set of actions, such as holding a key, sending a message etc.
Once the player enters the node's position, its actions are triggered.

To create a node, click on "Create node". This will open another window, from which you can
edit it. When you are done, click on "Finish".

Once you have put together your macro, you can save the node scene by clicking on
"Save scene", and load it again by clicking on "Load scene". The scenes
are saved under the name "yourscenename.mysecondmod.scene.txt", in the
base Minecraft folder.
